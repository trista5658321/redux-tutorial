# React 熱身：建立 Todo List app ( Demo-01 )
## 目標
練習 react 基礎語法及概念

## 基礎語法及概念
- JSX:
    - You can embed any JavaScript expression in JSX by wrapping it in curly braces.
    - JSX is an Expression Too
    - Specifying Attributes with JSX
    - Specifying Children with JSX
    - JSX Prevents Injection Attacks
- Rendering Elements
    - React elements are immutable
    - Only Updates What’s Necessary
- Components and Props
- State and Lifecycle
- Handling Events
- Conditional Rendering
- Lists and Keys
- Forms
- Lifting State Up
    - Case: several components need to reflect the same changing data
- Composition
    - Reuse code between components
    - Containment: components don’t know their children ahead of time
    - Specialization: components as being “special cases” of other components
- Thought process of building a app using React
- ES6: arrow function, class, spread operator...

## 思考
- 資料傳遞的方式？
- 各個 component 扮演什麼角色？

## 使用方式
下載專案，執行
```
